/**

 *
 * Proxy for Order resource on the server. This module was created seperately
 * (instead of adding it to the Order model), because it was difficult to
 * retrofit this functionality into Backbone's CRUD mechanism. For example, to create
 * a Order we need to send brokerageAccountId and orderParams to the server which are
 * not the exact attributes of an Order.
