/**

 *
 * Proxy for User resource on the server. This module was created seperately
 * (instead of adding it to the User model), because it was difficult to
 * retrofit this functionality into Backbone's CRUD mechanism. For example,
 * the User object does not contain a password, but a password is required to
 * create the user.
